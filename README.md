## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
The dataset I am using for this project is Denver Crime dataset downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset includes criminal offenses in the City and County of Denver for the previous five calendar years plus the current year to date. The data is based on the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) which includes all victims of person crimes and all crimes within an incident. 
After reviewing some basics of the dataset, here are a few questions I would like to investigate:
1. What are the most common offense categories and types in Denver?
2. What are the distribution of offense occured over time?
3. What are the offense occurence trend for difference offense categories?
4. What is the average occurence of crimes on each day in a year?
5. Which neighborhoods in Denver are the safest? Which ones are the most dangerous?

This notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The 'Denver Crime' dataset is very large so it was compressed in order to decrease the file size. The data can also be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/denver-crime-data).
## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@bh2589/denver-crime-data-exploration-a541c65e75c4).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/denver-crime-data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
